              <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Kharif crops, monsoon crops or autumn crops are domesticated plants like rice that are cultivated and harvested in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh during the Indian subcontinent's monsoon season, which lasts from June to November depending on the area. Monsoon rains may begin as early as May in some parts of the Indian subcontinent, and crops are generally harvested from 3rd Week of September to October, again depending upon the region and the crops. Rice,maize, sorghum and cotton are the major kharif crops in India.Rice is the most important kharif crop of India. It is grown in rain fed areas with hot and humid climates, especially the eastern and southern parts of India. Rice requires a temperature of 16–20 °C (61–68 °F) during the growing season and 18–32 °C (64–90 °F) during ripening. It needs rainfall from 150–200 centimetres (59–79 in) and needs a flooded field during the growth period.</p>

                <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Rabi crops or rabi harvest are agricultural crops that are sown in winter and harvested in the spring in India. The term is derived from the Arabic word for "spring", which is used in the Indian subcontinent, where it is the spring harvest.The opposite of rabi crops are the kharif crops which are grown after, the rabi and zaid (zaa-id) crops are harvested one after another respectively.The rabi crops are sown around mid-November, preferably after the monsoon rains are over, and harvesting begins in April / May. The crops are grown either with rainwater that has percolated into the ground, or using irrigation. A good rain in winter spoils the rabi crops but is good for kharif crops.

                  The major rabi crop in India is wheat, followed by barley, mustard, sesame and peas. Peas are harvested early, as they are ready early: Indian markets are flooded with green peas from January to March, peaking in February.
                  
                  Many crops are cultivated in both kharif and rabi seasons. The agriculture crops produced in India are seasonal in nature and highly dependent on these two monsoons.</p>

These crops are mainly grown in the summer season during a period called the "Zaid crop season." They require warm dry weather as major growth period and longer day length for flowering. The time between kharif crops and rabi crops.The zaid crops need dry weather with availability of irrigation facilities for a good harvest. The planting for shorter duration crops starts from February and last till April so that the land gets ready again for kharif sowing in June after monsoon sets in.</p>
